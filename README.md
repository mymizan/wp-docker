# WP-DOCKER
Docker development environment for WP

I am using [this](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/wordpress) WordPress image from Bitnami, but made some simple modifications to map my local  themes and plugins folder to the original image's plugins and themes folder. I preferred this over another approach due to its simplicity as I often develop in different machines.
